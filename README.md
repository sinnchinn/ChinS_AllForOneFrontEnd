    - build out the front end for all 10 mini challenges (not using guess it) using our api endpoints we created for the mini challenges

// Peer Review: I really like the design of your site, all the background images are great and the fonts were a really nice touch. The site ran well and was responsive, I had no problems with any of the endpoints and it all worked as intended. Good Job!
